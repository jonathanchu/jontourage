New Blog Platform
=================

After a long blogging hiatus, I recently decided to switch over my custom Django blog to a static site generator, following the trend that [many](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll) [others](https://github.com/lakshmivyas/hyde) have started.  What made the switch so appealing, going from a full-featured blogging engine to a simple static site generator, was that I could write my blog entries in a text editor of my choice and keep everything under version control with Git.  A simple push to the production server would serve my static pages up via Nginx, which in the end would take up far less resources and memory than a Django-powered blog application or even Wordpress.  So with that, I decided to search for a static site generator that I liked.  I did some research and narrowed my choices down to three static site generators:

- [Jekyll](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll) (Ruby-based)
- [Hyde](http://ringce.com/hyde) (Python-based)
- [Growl](https://github.com/xfire/growl) (Python-based)

Jekyll is the creation of [@mojombo](http://twitter.com/#!/mojombo), in which he refers to it as ["Blogging Like a Hacker"](http://tom.preston-werner.com/2008/11/17/blogging-like-a-hacker.html) as he so eloquently put it in his article.  He pretty much hit the nail on the head: blogging becomes a bit of a hassle when you use a complicated blogging engine like Wordpress and the likes.  [Many](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll/wiki/sites) are using this and seem to be very happy with it.

In the end, I chose [Growl](https://github.com/xfire/growl) because it was pure Python, had support for [Jinja2](http://jinja.pocoo.org/), and was extremely lightweight with few dependencies.  I decided not to go with Jekyll, arguably the most popular static site generator currently out there, because I wasn't too fond of the templating language.  Also, I decided not to go with Hyde simply because I prefer Jinja2 over Django templates, which is utilized in Hyde.

[Growl](https://github.com/xfire/growl) is written by [Rico Schiekel](http://downgra.de/) and "shamelessly stole some really cool ideas from Jekyll."  This blog is writen and compiled with a slightly modified version of [Growl](https://github.com/jonathanchu/growl).  So far, I'm loving the writing process:

- Write the article in Emacs
- Commit to Git repository
- Rsync the changes to my production server
- ...and that's it!

You can find out more about [Growl](https://github.com/jonathanchu/growl) by reading its documentation.  Here are some of the main features of Growl:

- Pages and posts have a YAML header
- Pages and posts are written in Markdown
- Layouts are written in HTML and Jinja2
